Building a Netflix Clone - React Tutorial - Styled Components - Firebase (Firestore &amp; Auth)

## About

This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up. The sign in will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database.

The app using React (useEffect, useState, useContext) and uses Styled Components for all the styling. It is used Fuse.js for live search, and to test components it is used React Testing Library. And of course it is used React router for navigation.

## The stack:

- React (react hooks, context)
- Firebase (Firestore/auth)
- Compound & Styled components
- Fuse.js
- React Testing Library

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
